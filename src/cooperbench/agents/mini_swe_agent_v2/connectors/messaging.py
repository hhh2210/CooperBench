"""Redis-based mailbox messaging between agents.

Provides simple send/receive messaging via Redis lists. Each agent has an inbox
that other agents can push messages to.

Example:
    connector = MessagingConnector(
        agent_id="agent1",
        agents=["agent1", "agent2"],
        url="redis://localhost:6379#run:abc123"
    )

    # Send to specific agent
    connector.send("agent2", "I found a bug in auth.py")

    # Receive pending messages
    messages = connector.receive()

    # Broadcast to all
    connector.broadcast("I'm starting on the API changes")
