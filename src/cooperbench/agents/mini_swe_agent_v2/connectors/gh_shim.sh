# Minimal `gh` for CooperBench: pull requests against the shared `origin` remote.
#
# Agents already know `gh pr create` / `gh pr diff` — those commands are everywhere in
# training data. A bespoke command with the same behaviour would not be, so this shim keeps
# the real spelling and implements it with plain git against the team remote.
#
# A PR tracks a BRANCH, the way GitHub does: you open it early so your colleague has context
# for what you are doing, then keep committing, and the new commits are part of it
# automatically. Opening one is recorded as an annotated tag holding the title and body; the
# content is always the current tip of your branch, never a commit frozen at open time.
#
#   refs/tags/pr/<agent_id>   ->  marker, message = "<title>\n\n<body>"
#   refs/heads/<agent_id>     ->  the content, updated by every push
#
# There is no GitHub and no network here. Anything not implemented says so plainly rather
# than failing in a way that reads like a transient error.
