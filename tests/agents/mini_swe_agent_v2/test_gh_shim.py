"""Tests for the `gh` shim that gives coop agents pull requests over the team remote.

These run the real script against real git repositories — no mocks — because every property
worth asserting here is a property of git refs, and a mocked `git` would assert only that the
script calls the commands the test already assumed it would.

The behaviour that matters most is that a PR **tracks the branch**: agents are told to open one
early so a colleague has context, then keep committing. A PR pinned to the commit that existed
at open time would silently submit a fraction of the work, and nothing downstream could tell.
